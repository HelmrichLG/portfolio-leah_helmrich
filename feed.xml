After transferring the text to a blank adhesive label, I changed a few of the connection points by hand, to ensure they were wide enough to be sturdy. Then I cut the piece out of 22 gauge sheet brass. After filing and smoothing all of the edges, I gave the entire bracelet a hammered and peened texture. The last steps were to shape the bracelet and to make a chain clasp for it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The first step of making this bracelet was to generate the text in the desired font, with kerning adjusted so it was as small as possible, giving the letters as many connections as possible.

Using blank adhesive labels, I transferred the link designs onto 20 gauge sheet brass in preparation for piercing and sawing.
After all the pieces were cut out and filed smooth, I slotted them together and soldered the cuts of the open links, creating a solid chain. The last step was to solder a few links for the chain of the toggle clasp and to give the piece an interesting patina.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I started with a basic geometric shape and designed a number of different sized and shaped link patterns.
