Leah wrapped her first headpin when she was 12 and she has hardly set her pliers down since! Starting with basic beading and stringing, Leah began a small business selling pieces to friends. Discovering that she simply adored this creative outlet, Leah dived in to all things jewelry, learning beadweaving, wire wrapping, and chainmaille in quick succession.  

Leah’s love of all things jewelry even inspired her family members to join in, starting a jewelry supply business based on quality, handmade jump rings and findings. Over the next few years, as her family’s business started to grow, so did Leah’s skills. She now specializes in repair and custom work, gravitating towards wire wrapping and silversmithing. While she has her wheelhouse skills down pat, she takes every opportunity to learn something new! Prop work and sewn items are two new additions to Leah’s’ repertoire, opening new mixed media possibilities.  

Leah has studied under various artisans including several at The William Holland School of Lapidary Arts and The Craft Alliance of St. Louis. Leah has also had three tutorials published in Interweave publications and has written countless others for Creating Unkamen, LLC.
