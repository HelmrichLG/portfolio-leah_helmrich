Faced with the high sides of a druzy cabachon, I decided to try a riveted prong setting based on a rectangular platform, to help enforce the geometric edges of the crystaline structure. The prongs were riveted to the flat base which was in turn riveted to the ring band. I carefully closed the ring band with two more rivets and after shaping it, decided to add a small leaf stamp. I annealed the prongs, cleaned everything up, and set the stone securely.
