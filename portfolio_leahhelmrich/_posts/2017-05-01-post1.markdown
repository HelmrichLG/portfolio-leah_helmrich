Using three strips of wire in copper, bronze, and brass, I made three nesting rings, each one a little bigger and a little wider than the one inside it. The two outer rings had holes in a variety of sizes drilled through them so you could see the layers of metal underneath.
To form the ring, I carefully nested all the rings and then used a dapping block to round the outside edges of the largest ring, flipping it over frequently to create an even dome, trapping the two inner bands inside.
