I sketched all of the various layers for the pendant, cutting them out of paper to make sure everything lined up. Then using matte, polished, and anodized aluminum sheet, I saw cut the 6 pieces out and drilled all the holes needed. I cut 9 rivets, including the one to attatch the bail and carefully peened them all into place, securing the layers together.
