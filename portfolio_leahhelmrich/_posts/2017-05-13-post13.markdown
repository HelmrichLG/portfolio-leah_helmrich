Starting with sterling silver wire in 18 and 20 gauge, I cut 10-15 pieces and balled both ends. I roughly shaped the pieces and stacked them in a loose horseshoe shape. Using silver solder in wire form, I fused all the pieces together, focusing on the middle. Once everything was soldered, I began to finalize the shape, working in a little at a time with each tendril until the focal stone was securely pinned in place.
