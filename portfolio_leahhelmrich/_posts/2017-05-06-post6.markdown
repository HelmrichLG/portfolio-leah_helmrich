Made with sheet sterling silver and niobium, I cut four matching squares, two of each material. I anodized the niobium with a rainbow progression of colors and cut a number of squares and triangles out of the silver pieces. Then I soldered a post of the cufflink bases and drilled a hole through the center of the squares. Stacking a silver square on top of a niobium one, I carefully riveted the post, holding the two squares securely on the cufflink base.
